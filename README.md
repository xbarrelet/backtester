Algorithmic Trading Strategy Optimization Approaches
When optimizing a multi-indicator trading strategy like yours, there are several effective approaches to consider:


Hierarchical Optimization
This is often the most practical approach:


1. Individual Indicator Optimization

- Optimize each indicator separately (TTM Squeeze, Vortex, etc.)
- For each indicator, determine its optimal parameters while keeping others at default values
- This reduces the search space dramatically

2. Staged Combination
- Start with your most important indicator optimized
- Add the next most important indicator with its optimal parameters
- Fine-tune the combination before adding the next indicator

Alternative Approaches

- Grid Search with Reduced Parameter Space
-  Identify the most sensitive parameters through initial testing
-  Create a smaller grid of these key parameters to test combinations

- Walk-Forward Optimization
-  Test parameters on successive time windows
-  Only keep parameters that work consistently across different periods

- Cross-Asset Validation
-  Test parameters across multiple symbols/timeframes
-  Choose parameters that work well across different markets

grid search, genetic algorithms, and machine learning methods?

Avoiding Overfitting
Use longer testing periods covering different market regimes
Apply statistical significance tests to results
Measure parameter sensitivity (stable parameters are less likely overfit)
Enforce simplicity - fewer parameters generally means more robustness
Maintain adequate out-of-sample testing data
The hierarchical approach (optimize individually then combine) is generally most efficient while still producing 
good results for complex strategies like yours.


You can ask Claude for different exit strategies, different nnfx model strategies, ...
- primary trend indicator - defines overall market direction
- two or more confirmation indicators - confirm trade entry
- one volume or volatility indicator - helps validate trade strength
- stop loss indicator - uses an atr-based stop loss (later compare with fixed percents? Other options?)
- risk-reward management - includes a fixed R/R ratio for take profit (later compare with fixed percents? Other options?)
- emergency exit indicator - identifies when to close a trade early
- requirements: avoid common indicators like RSI, Macd and moving averages.
- constraints: the strategu should focus on high-probability trades and strict risk management.

To avoid the memory issues from last backtesting you could save every results in db first and then analyze them all in
a final phase? If everything is reactive it should be fine no?
